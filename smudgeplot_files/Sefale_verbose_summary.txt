1n coverage estimates (Coverage of every haplotype; Don't confuse with genome coverage which is (ploidy * 1n coverage).)
* User defined 1n coverage:	
* Subset 1n coverage estimate:	13.8
* Highest peak 1n coverage estimate:	12.3
1n coverage used in smudgeplot (one of the three above):	12.3
* Estimated ploidy:	4
* Minimal number of heterozygous loci:	24029
Note: This number is NOT an estimate of the total number heterozygous loci, it's merly setting the lower boundary if the inference of heterozygosity peaks is correct.
* Proportion of heterozygosity carried by pairs in different genome copies (table)
