[424|sudgeplot err] !! Careful, your coverage filter on the lower end (L = 	10	) is higher than half of the 1n coverage estimate ( 1n / 2 = 	5.86
[424|sudgeplot err] If the real 1n coverage is half of your estimate you would not picked it up due to the filtering.
[424|sudgeplot err] Consider reruning the analysis with lover L as well (something like (1n / 2) - 5 should do the job)
[424|sudgeplot err] Another good way for verificaiton would be to compare it to GenomeScope estimate of haploid coverage
